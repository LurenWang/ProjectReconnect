      <p>Project Reconnect is a project from Columbia University which helps match missing children with their parents using genomic data.</p>

        <p>Project Reconnect utilizes the latest advances in Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) data collection in order to efficiently and economically find parent-child relationships in large populations of individuals.
Conceptually, SNP genotypes can be thought of as genetic barcodes which are unique to individuals and also inherited from parent to child.</p>
<p>With just 384 positions along the genome, Project Reconnect is able to accurately identify parent-child relationships from billions of people.
Since our method requires such few SNP positions, the “chips” which collect this data from parents and children can be produced at a low cost allowing for wide usage.
Clients may process their SNP data at their most convenient location either in person or by mail and send us the results.
Our online database can then help them find lost loved ones also in the system.</p>
<p>The Reconnect algorithm works based upon a very simple biological principle; a person obtains genes from his or her parents.
At each SNP location, a person has two nucleotides and each nucleotide can be one of two types.
So, if a child is a homozygote meaning both of his or her nucleotides are the same, then the parent must carry at least one of that nucleotide in that position.
Using the fact that a child and parent relationship must have at least one nucleotide of the same type the matching algorithm quickly finds parents who are the most likely match for each child.
Our combination of cost-effective physical hardware and optimized digital processes allow Project Reconnect to efficiently and cheaply be used by anyone who wants to combat child exploitation.</p>

        <p>Project Reconnect aims to use DNA technology to bring home missing children.
          The Project was founded at Columbia University with the first prototype launching on May 2, 2016.</p>
          <p>The initial focus of Reconnect is on Chinese and Indian population groups due to the high rate of human trafficking and child abduction in these countries.
          We hope that this online service will enable parents, law enforcement, and the general public to combat the victimization of children.</p>
          <p>Jianyi Ren, Luren Wang, and Calvin Tjandra form the team behind Project Reconnect under the advisement of Professor Itsik Pe’er at Columbia University.
          This work was the result of a class project in Computational Genomics.</p>
